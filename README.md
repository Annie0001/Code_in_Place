# Wordle Program
### The program should ask the user for a 5-character word
### The program then should compare the user input word with the random word from the dictionary.
### The program should hint to the user if any characters from the word are in the correct place. Or If any character does not exist at all, or if         any character exists but is not in the right place.
### The dictionary is in an array and has 20 words in that array.
### Randomly pick one word from the array. This would be the dictionary word that the user should guess. 
### Compare user input to the random word above, character by character, and output which one is right or wrong.
### Write the program so that it asks the user up to 6 times and lets the user guess by hinting which characters are right or wrong
